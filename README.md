RaySim
======

Browser-based 2-dimensional ray-tracing optics simulator using geometrical optics.
Allows the user to add standard optical elements, like light sources, mirrors and lenses, to an in-browser SVG canvas.
Also custom-shaped optical elements from Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator can be imported.
Material properties, like the refraction index, can be adjusted inline.
Optical elements can be rotated and moved around on the canvas.
The deflection of rays from a light source by optical elements is calculated and displayed live.
Besides the visual impression also the exact geometrical solution of these deflections is shown.

Automatic calculation of focal points and image planes is planed.

The designed optical setups can be exported as SVG and be re-imported lateron.
